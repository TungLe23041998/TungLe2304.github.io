# Search Input animation (pure css, without svg)
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/suez/pen/MYxGab](https://codepen.io/suez/pen/MYxGab).

 Original demo - http://codepen.io/suez/pen/ogVqYW
Based on https://dribbble.com/shots/1992789-Search

This demo have only one problem - no input autofocus after opening click :(

UPDATED: added variables for width, height and border-width, so now you can easily change overall dimensions of this search input.
